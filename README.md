# Linked List

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a **sequence of nodes**. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the sequence is called the head, and the last node is called the tail.

# Linked List Operations

## Inserting a node

To insert a node into a linked list, you need to specify the data to be stored in the node and the node after which the new node should be inserted. The new node will be inserted after the specified node.

## Deleting a node

To delete a node from a linked list, you need to specify the node to be deleted. The node will be deleted from the list.

## Searching for a node

To search for a node in a linked list, you need to specify the data that is stored in the node you are searching for. The linked list will be searched for the node, and the node will be returned if it is found.

## Iterating over a linked list

To iterate over a linked list, you can use a for loop to iterate over the nodes in the list. For each node, you can then access the data stored in the node.
